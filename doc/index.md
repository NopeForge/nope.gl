# Nope Foundry documentation

The [Nope Foundry project][nope-foundry] provides a free and open source cross-platform
framework for **motion design**, **2D composition** and **visual effects**.

This documentation is split into 2 main sections: **user** and **developers**
documentation. General usage (including programming interfaces) belongs to the
former; the latter refers to development within the project itself.

Within each section, the documentation follows the *Divio documentation system*,
which means it is structured into 4 main categories:
- **Tutorials**: introduction to general concepts to get started with the
  project
- **How-to guides**: step-by-step instructions and examples to cover common
  usage questions
- **Discussions and explanations**: provides clarifications and background on
  key topics
- **Reference documentation**: the technical and exhaustive reference

The whole documentation is updated automatically according to changes happening
in the [main GitHub repository][nopegl].
