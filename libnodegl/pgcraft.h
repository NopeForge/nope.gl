     * Just like the other types (uniforms, blocks, attributes), this field

     * associated with the pipeline straight after the pipeline initialization

     * though, there is one exception: if the specified type is
     * NGLI_PGCRAFT_SHADER_TEX_TYPE_VIDEO, then the texture field must be NULL.
     * Indeed, this type implies the potential use of multiple samplers (which
     * can be hardware accelerated and platform/backend specific) depending on
     * the image layout. This means that a single texture cannot be used as a
     * default resource for all these samplers. Moreover, the image layout
     * (which determines which samplers are used) is generally unknown at
     * pipeline initialization and it is only known once a frame has been
     * decoded/mapped. The image structure describes which layout to use and
     * which textures to bind and the pgcraft_texture_info.fields describes
     * where to bind the textures and their associated data.
